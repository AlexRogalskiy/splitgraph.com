# R, RStudio

The `RPostgres` driver does not support connecting to clients which have disabled prepared statements (see the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/r-dbi/RPostgres/issues/185) for details) so it is recommended that you use the `RPostgreSQL` driver instead.

For example:

```r
library(DBI)
library(RPostgreSQL)
library(dbplyr)

connection <- dbConnect(
  dbDriver("PostgreSQL"),
  host = "data.splitgraph.com",
  dbname = "ddn",
  user = "...",
  password = "..."
)
```
