### Peer-to-Peer

Any Splitgraph instance can act as a [remote](/docs/architecture/splitgraph-remotes),
allowing you to share data with other engines in a decentralized fashion. Access
control works on top of PostgreSQL authentication, so any [PostgreSQL authentication method](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-methods.html),
including PAM, LDAP or RADIUS, will work with Splitgraph.

The [decentralized demo](/docs/getting-started/decentralized-demo) will show you how to run
two Splitgraph engines using Docker Compose and share data between them.

Splitgraph also supports [pushing data to S3-compatible object storage](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/push-to-object-storage),
allowing you to store Splitgraph data cheaply and still have it available to query on demand.

### Auto-generated REST API

Data images that are pushed out to [Splitgraph Cloud](/docs/splitgraph-cloud/introduction)
get an OpenAPI-compatible REST endpoint generated for them, provided by [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/latest/).
OpenAPI is a standard for REST APIs that allows clients to get structured information about methods supported by the API and supports [client code generation for over 30 languages](https://openapi-generator.tech/).

Check out a [sample REST API](https://www.splitgraph.com/splitgraph/congress_tweets/latest/-/api-schema) for the `splitgraph/congress_tweets` dataset on Splitgraph Cloud.

### Access an ever-growing library of data

[Splitgraph Cloud](https://www.splitgraph.com/explore) indexes over 40000 data repositories, either hosted
by Splitgraph or for which we have written adapters. All of these repositories are ready to be
cloned to your [Splitgraph engine](/docs/architecture/splitgraph-engine) and queried by
[any PostgreSQL client](/product/splitgraph/integrations), used in [Splitfiles](/docs/concepts/splitfiles)
or joined with your own datasets to enrich your research.
