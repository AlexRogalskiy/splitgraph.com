};

When an image is cloned or used in the Splitfile executor, only the repository (or single image)'s
metadata is downloaded. The metadata consists of all Splitgraph state tables in `splitgraph_meta`:
`images`, `objects`, `tags` and `tables`. Compared to the actual data, it's very lightweight,
most of its footprint being taken up by the object index.

Data downloads are forced during a checkout (which downloads all objects required by an image).
Queries to tables in layered checkouts only download objects that are required to satisfy that
query, as determined by the object index.

Objects that were downloaded from a remote engine are considered to be "cached" and
can be evicted if the free cache space is limited. The cache size can be controlled by the
`SG_OBJECT_CACHE_SIZE` variable in `.sgconfig` and the default value is 10240 (10GB).

It is possible to find out how much data a query against a layered checkout will need by running
`EXPLAIN` on the query.
