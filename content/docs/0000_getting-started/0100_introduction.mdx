What if you could `git push` your database?

Splitgraph is a data management tool and a data sharing platform inspired by Docker and Git.

Splitgraph allows the user to manipulate data images (snapshots of SQL tables at a given point in time) as if they
were code repositories: by creating, versioning, sharing and downloading them. This is all done seamlessly, so that
any tool that interacts with a Splitgraph table has no idea it's not just an ordinary database table.

Furthermore, Splitgraph also defines a Splitfile language that is used to derive datasets from other datasets whilst
being able to keep track of their provenance and update the image when its dependencies are updated. You can even
plug another database into Splitgraph and query data from it as if it were just another set of tables.
