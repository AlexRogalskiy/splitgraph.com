This quick series of Asciicasts will guide you through using Splitgraph to:

  * Ingest a dataset from a CSV file
  * Build a derivative dataset using Splitfiles
  * Make some changes to the dataset and commit those changes
  * Check the dataset's provenance and rebuild it against a changed upstream
  * Share a dataset with another Splitgraph engine

## Ingesting CSV files

## Splitfiles for building datasets

[Link to example](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/splitfile)

<cast src="@splitgraph/content/casts/versioned/latest/splitfiles.cast" />

## Sharing datasets with other engines

This requires you to use docker-compose to run the two engines instead of `sgr engine`.
