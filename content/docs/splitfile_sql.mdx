**`SQL command`**

Runs a (potentially arbitrary) SQL statement. The command is supposed to perform actions
on tables in the current `OUTPUT` repository (the command is executed with the `OUTPUT` schema
being the default one) and isn't supposed to read/change data in/from other schemas.

The image hash produced by this command is a combination of the current
`OUTPUT` hash and the hash of the SQL statement. Note that non-deterministic
SQL statements, for example `SELECT random()`, will produce the same hash given the same inputs.
