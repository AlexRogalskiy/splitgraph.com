## sgr sql

```sgr sql [OPTIONS] SQL```

Run an SQL statement against the Splitgraph engine.

There are no restrictions on the contents of the statement: this is the same as running it
from any other PostgreSQL client.

If ``--schema`` is specified, the statement is run with the ``search_path`` set to that schema. This means
that these statements are equivalent::

    sgr sql "SELECT * FROM "noaa/climate".table"
    sgr sql -s noaa/climate "SELECT * FROM table"

If `--image` is specified, this will run the statement against that image using layered querying.
Only read-only statements are supported. For example:

    sgr sql -i noaa/climate:latest "SELECT * FROM table"

### Options

  * **`-s, --schema TEXT`**: Run SQL against this schema.
  * **`-i, --image IMAGE`**: Run SQL against this image.
  * **`-a, --show-all`**: Returns all results of the query.
