## prune

```sgr prune [OPTIONS] REPOSITORY```

Cleanup dangling images from a repository.

This includes images not pointed to by any tags (or checked out) and those that aren't required by any of
such images.

Will ask for confirmation of the deletion, unless ``-y ``is passed. If ``-r`` (``--remote``) is
passed, this will perform deletion on a remote Splitgraph engine (registered in the config) instead, assuming
the user has write access to the remote repository.

This does not delete any physical objects that the deleted repository/images depend on:
use ``sgr cleanup`` to do that.

### Options

  * **`-r, --remote TEXT`**: Perform the deletion on a remote instead, specified by its alias
  * **`-y, --yes`**: Agree to deletion without confirmation
