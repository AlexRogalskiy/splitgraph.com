Splitgraph can also work with [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/), an extension for PostgreSQL that adds support for geospatial data. By default, the Splitgraph engine doesn't come with PostGIS installed, but you can use a PostGIS-enabled engine Docker image or build your own.

The [PostGIS example](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/v0.1.0/examples/postgis) will guide you through plotting a map of votes in New York City in the 2016 US Presidential Election using Splitgraph, PostGIS and [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/).
