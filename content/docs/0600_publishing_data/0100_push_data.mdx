## Other engines

Datasets can be shared with other Splitgraph engines, similarly to git. Splitgraph currently
doesn't support merging changes and pull requests, instead encouraging to submit changes to datasets
as changes to build Splitfiles that build the data.

The [two-engine example](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/push-to-other-engine)
showcases pushing data between two engines linked together with docker-compose.

## Splitgraph Cloud

If you're interesting in pushing your dataset to the Splitgraph Registry, please follow the
[Splitgraph Cloud guide](../splitgraph_cloud/introduction).
